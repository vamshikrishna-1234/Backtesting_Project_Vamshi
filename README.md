# Backtesting_Project_Vamshi
A Python backtesting project using Backtrader library that implements and analyzes a Parabolic SAR and Simple Moving Average Crossover strategy on Amazon (AMZN) historical data from Yahoo Finance, complete with performance metrics and trade analytics.


Detailed:
1)I Developed and backtested an automated trading strategy using Parabolic SAR (Stop and Reverse) and Simple Moving Average crossovers with the Backtrader Python framework on Amazon (AMZN) historical data.

2)Leveraged the Backtrader Python framework to rigorously backtest the algorithm on (AMZN) historical OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) data from Yahoo Finance.

3)Achieved a net profit of $157,859, compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 17.1% over 5.75 years, with a Sharpe Ratio of 0.67 and a maximum drawdown of 29.6%.

Interpreting the Backtrader Strategy Plot:

The attached image is a comprehensive visualization generated by Backtrader after running your trading strategy on Amazon (AMZN) historical data. Here’s what each section of the plot represents:

1. Portfolio Value and Cash Over Time (Top Panel):
   
Blue Line: Shows the total portfolio value (cash + holdings) as it changes throughout the backtest.

Red Line: Indicates the cash available in your account.

Y-Axis (Right): Portfolio value scale.

Y-Axis (Left): Cash scale.

Interpretation: You can see how the strategy grows (or declines) your initial capital over time, with jumps or drops corresponding to major trades.

2. Trade Profit/Loss Markers (Second Panel):

Blue Dots: Trades that resulted in a net profit.

Red Dots: Trades that resulted in a net loss.

Interpretation: This panel visually summarizes which trades were winners or losers and when they occurred.

3. Price Chart and Indicators (Main Panel):
   
Candlestick or Line Plot: Represents the daily closing prices of AMZN.

Buy/Sell Markers:

Green Triangles: Buy signals (entries).

Red Triangles: Sell signals (exits).

Parabolic SAR (black dotted line): Highlights trend reversals and trailing stop levels.

SMA Lines:

SMA (12): Fast simple moving average.

SMA (26): Slow simple moving average.

Interpretation: This is the core of our strategy—showing how our indicators interact with price and where trades are executed.

4. Volume (Below Main Panel):

Bar Chart: Daily trading volume for AMZN.

Interpretation: Helps contextualize price moves and trade entries/exits with market activity.

5. Crossover Indicator (Bottom Panel):
   
Red Line: Shows the output of our SMA crossover indicator:

Value above zero: Fast SMA is above slow SMA (bullish crossover).

Value below zero: Fast SMA is below slow SMA (bearish crossover).

Interpretation: Lets you visually confirm when your moving average crossover signals occurred relative to trades.
